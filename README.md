# scRNA-tutorial
This repository contains a complete R-based workflow for the preprocessing, quality control, and integration of single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. The pipeline is designed to handle multiple samples, perform rigorous QC, and integrate datasets using Harmony to remove batch effects across different clinical conditions and lastly find DEGs.
